# Week 1 - Challenge
As our end of week 1 challenge, we were asked to refactor existing code to meet the following user story. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Actual Behaviour

```
The word 'SEO' is a different color in the header Horiseon.
The nav bar becomes black when it is hovered over and turns the same color as SEO when it has been clicked. 
The CSS is keeping all the semantic elements in position, both aside and setting images to float left/right. 
Classes and ID's have been applied to sections and specific elements. 
The footer has had the text updated to reflect the current year of 2023.
Alt attributes have been added and are accessible. 
The HTML and CSS follow a sequential order. 
The title has been changed to meet requirements. 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

```
> **Important** This is an not an exhuastive list of the work carried out.
